# Analyzing Costs of Centralized Wastewater Facilities in Oregon

This repository includes data, scripts, and analysis done for a Data Science for the Public Good project at Oregon State University in summer 2020. This project is currently being worked on by Jakob Oetinger, Amanda Reding, and Grayson White, all under the supervision of Dr. Christine Kelly. 

The goal of this project is to provide rural communities with insights to the cost of implimenting a centralized wastewater facility in their area. To achieve that, we will create a  model that will predict the cost required to impliment such a system. This model will be focused on predicting the cost of small (<1 MGD) wastewater facilities.
