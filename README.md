# Data Science for the Public Good

## Rural Wastewater Facility Cost Modeling & Planning Tools

### Overview
This repository includes data, scripts, and analysis done for a Data Science for the Public Good project at Oregon State University in summer 2020. This project is currently being worked on by Jakob Oetinger, Amanda Reding, and Grayson White, all under the supervision of Dr. Christine Kelly. 

The goal of this project is to provide rural communities with insights to the cost of implimenting a centralized wastewater facility in their area. To achieve that, we will create a  model that will predict the cost required to impliment such a system. This model will be focused on predicting the cost of small (<1 MGD) wastewater facilities.

### Shiny
We are also creating a `shiny` web application that can be found [here](https://graysonwhite.shinyapps.io/oregon-wwtps/). The intended audience for this application are people within city government who are trying to understand the process of moving from a decentralized septic system to a centralized wastewater treatment system.

### Preliminary Results & Analysis 
We have began to characterize wastewater treatment plants in Oregon, and we have found some interesting results about their structure, location, and cost. 

Below, we have a plot of 114 small (<1 MGD) wastewater treatment plants in Oregon:
