# Collection

#### Wastewater collection systems transport wastewater from where it is generated (homes, businesses, public venues, etc.) to a centralized collection facility. The components of the collection system includes pipes, tanks, manholes, and lift stations. Typically, the initial cost of a collection system is much greater than the treatment facility. The Water Environment Federation maintains a site containing technical information and guidance on wastewater collection systems at [this page.](https://www.wef.org/resources/topics/browse-topics-a-n/collection-systems/)
