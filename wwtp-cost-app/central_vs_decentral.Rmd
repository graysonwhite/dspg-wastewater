## **Centralized Wastewater Treatment**  

### Treatment Process    

#### **Preliminary treatment**  
>	Preliminary treatment protects equipment by removing larger items that cannot decompose and could clog or damage the treatment equipment. Types of preliminary treatment include bar screens that remove larger debris, comminutors that grind up larger debris, grit chambers that slow down flow to allow inorganic solids to settle out of the water, and pre-aeration to help remove grease and oil as well as increase dissolved oxygen.  

#### **Primary Treatment**  
>	The goal of primary treatment is to slow down the wastewater and allow solids to settle out. This takes place in primary clarifiers and septic tanks.  

#### **Secondary Treatment**  
>	Secondary treatment is used when wastewater is not sufficiently treated to be safely discharged. Examples of secondary treatment include septic tank drain fields, sequencing batch reactors, lagoons, trickling filters, and rotating biological contactors.  

#### **Disinfection**  
>	Disinfection is used to kill potentially harmful pathogens in the water. Common types of disinfection include chorination and ultraviolet light.  

#### **Tertiary Treatment**  
>  Tertiary treatment is needed when
